Notes on the MAX485 module: uses a MAX485 ESA +18DN chip
The receiver input has a fail-safe feature that guarantees a logic-high output if the input is open circuit.
Bus idle state: A high B low -> RO high
if _RE_ is low, RO is enabled.
If DI is low, output Y is low and output Z is high.
-->if Y connected to A, then DI low causes RO low.

PICAXE sertxd and serrxd are: All data bytes sent have 8 data bits, use no partity and have 1 stop bit. 
Nxxx baud rates idle low, with pulses going high.
Txxx baud rates idle high, with pulses going low
sertxd and serrxd are equivalent to N4800.

es, SERTXD idles low. The data bits are inverted so you can send a pulse of varying length SERTXD(value) will give ...

$FF - 1 bit  1111 1111
$FE - 2	     1111 1110
$FC - 3      1111 1100
$F8 - 4
$F0 - 5
$E0 - 6
$C0 - 7
$80 - 8
$00 - 9
